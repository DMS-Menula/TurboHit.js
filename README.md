## 🔥 What is TurboHit.js?

**TurboHit.js** is a developer-focused utility to **send bursts of GET requests** to any URL — **with full control over delay, total requests, and safety locks.**

✅ Great for:
- Backend performance testing
- Caching warm-ups
- Monitoring reliability
- Localhost server stress tests

❌ Not for:
- DDoS
- Malicious use
- Targeting others’ servers without permission

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ 100% Node.js (no dependencies)
- 🔒 Built-in safety guard (prevents abuse)
- ⏱️ Adjustable delay (ms)
- 📈 Real-time logs
- 🌐 Supports HTTPS + HTTP
- 🧪 Works great with `localhost`, `httpbin`, etc.
